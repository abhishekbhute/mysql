MY SQL JOINS

1)INNER JOIN 
2)LEFT OUTER JOIN 
3)RIGHT OUTER JOIN


1)INNER JOIN
INNER JOIN is used to return all rows from multiple tables where the join condition is satisfied. It is the most common type of join.
    SELECT columns  
    FROM table1   
    INNER JOIN table2  
    ON table1.column = table2.column;  


2)LEFT OUTER JOIN
LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all the rows from the left hand table specified in ON condition and only those rows from the other table where the join condition is satisfied.
    SELECT columns  
    FROM table1  
    LEFT [OUTER] JOIN table2  
    ON table1.column = table2.column; 


3)RIGHT OUTER JOIN
Right Outer Join returns all rows from the RIGHT-hand table specified in the ON condition and only those rows from the other table where he join condition is fulfilled.
    SELECT columns  
    FROM table1  
    RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN table2  
    ON table1.column = table2.column;  


3)join multiple tables using INNER JOIN
SELECT columns  
FROM table1  
INNER JOIN table2 ON condition1  
INNER JOIN table3 ON condition2

SELECT customer_id, cust_name, occupation, price, date  
FROM customers  
LEFT JOIN orders   
USING(customer_id) WHERE price>2500; 


5)CROSS JOIN
CROSS JOIN is used to combine all possibilities of the two or more tables and returns the result that contains every row from all contributing tables.
SELECT columns_list
FROM TABLE1
CROSS JOIN TABLE2;

6)join multiple tables using CROSS JOIN
SELECT * FROM customer  
LEFT JOIN(orders CROSS JOIN contacts)  
ON customer.customer_id=contact_id  
ORDER BY income

7)DELETE JOIN
DELETE target table   
FROM    table1

ON table1.joining_column= table2.joining_column  
WHERE   condition 


8)UNION
SELECT column FROM TABLE1
